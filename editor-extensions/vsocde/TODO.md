# Tasks
- add TODOS support.
    - unfortunatley, this feature was developed not knowing text decorators are not clickable. So its either code lens or "decorator + text decorator".
    - decorators click word by word not "entire line" so the white space wont work. it feels weird.
    - I dont want two decorators just to have an underline, so I will stick with the code lens to keep it simple for now.
    - If I was only allowing the clicking of a "tdodo ID" then the decorator would make more sense.
- add BUGS support. This feature needs to thought out. But it will be similar to other extensions. I need to write out tasks here.
- use varied colors for the highlighting
- create command to create new taskp file
- create command that for runs scanner

- move to its own repo and update package.json
- update readme to be an actual guide
